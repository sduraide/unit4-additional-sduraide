# Unit 3: Editable Nodes

## Design Question (15pts)

### Justification for WYSIWYG vs Markup (6 pts)
- I built a WYSIWYG editor. I wanted to create a text editor that had a usable interface for users not familiar with coding or scripting for a simple note taking use case. 
- While taking notes, users don't have to worry about preview vs actual rendering. The changes will be reflected immediately as well. It would be good to have some styling which is not as intuitive in Markdown. Anyone can use WYSIWYG
- The extensions I used and justifications for them are below

### Justification for Remirror extensions (9 pts)
Font Size: For accessibility, it could be useful to have an option to make the text bigger instead of zooming in on the entire window.
Font Family: I have serif and sans serif options for typographic reasons. If the text needs to be formal, you could use serif fonts whereas for informal text, you could use sans serif.
Heading: To create a text hierarchy it could be useful to have different heading sizes different title from the body, etc.
