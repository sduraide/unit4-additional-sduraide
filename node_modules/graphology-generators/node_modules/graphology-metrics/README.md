  multiMixedDensity,
  multiDirectedDensity,
  multiUndirectedDensity

### Degree

Returns degree information for every node in the graph. Note that [`graphology`](https://graphology.github.io)'s API already gives you access to this information through `#.degree` etc. So only consider this function as a convenience to extract/assign all degrees at once.

```js
import degree from 'graphology-metrics/degree';

import degree, {
  inDegree,
  outDegree,
  undirectedDegree,
  directedDegree,
  allDegree
} from 'graphology-metrics/degree';

// To extract degree information for every node
const degrees = degree(graph);
>>> {node1: 34, node2: 45, ...}

// To extract only in degree information for every node
const inDegrees = inDegree(graph);

// To extract full degree breakdown for every node
const degrees = allDegree(graph);
>>> { // Assuming the graph is directed
  node1: {
    inDegree: 2,
    outDegree: 36
  },
  ...
}

// To map degree information to node attributes
degree.assign(graph);
graph.getNodeAttribute(node, 'degree');
>>> 45

// To map only degree & in degree to node attributes
allDegree.assign(graph, {types: ['degree', 'inDegree']});

// To map only degree & in degree with different names
allDegree(
  graph,
  {
    attributes: {
      inDegree: 'in',
      outDegree: 'out'
    },
    types: ['inDegree', 'outDegree']
  }
)
>>> {
  1: {in: 1, out: 1},
  ...
}
```

_Arguments_

- **graph** _Graph_: target graph.
- **options** _?object_: options:
  - **attributes** _?object_: Custom attribute names:
    - **degree** _?string_: Name of the mixed degree attribute.
    - **inDegree** _?string_: Name of the mixed inDegree attribute.
    - **outDegree** _?string_: Name of the mixed outDegree attribute.
    - **undirectedDegree** _?string_: Name of the mixed undirectedDegree attribute.
    - **directedDegree** _?string_: Name of the mixed directedDegree attribute.
  - **types** _?array_: List of degree types to extract.

### Eccentricity

Computes the eccentricity which is the maximum of the shortest paths between the given node and any other node.

```js
import {eccentricity} from 'graphology-metrics';
// Alternatively, to load only the relevant code:
import eccentricity from 'graphology-metrics/eccentricity';

graph.addNode('1');
graph.addNode('2');
graph.addNode('3');
graph.addNode('4');
graph.addUndirectedEdge(1, 2);
graph.addUndirectedEdge(2, 3);
graph.addUndirectedEdge(3, 1);
graph.addUndirectedEdge(3, 4);

eccentricity(graph, 3) >> 1;
```

_Arguments_

- **graph** _Graph_: target graph.
- **node** _any_: desired node.

### Modalities

Method returning a node categorical attribute's modalities and related statistics.

```js
import modalities from 'graphology-metrics/modalities';

// Retrieving the 'type' attribute's modalities
const info = modalities(graph, 'type');
>>> {
  value1: {
    nodes: 34,
    internalEdges: 277,
    internalDensity: 0.03,
    externalEdges: 45,
    externalDensity: 0.05,
    inboundEdges: 67,
    inboundDensity: 0.07,
    outboundEdges: 124,
    outboundDensity: 0.003
  },
  ...
}

// Retrieving modalities info for several attributes at once
const info = modalities(graph, ['type', 'lang']);
>>> {
  type: {...},
  lang: {...}
}
```

_Arguments_

- **graph** _Graph_: target graph.
- **attribute** _string|array_: target categorical attribute or array of categorical attributes.

### Edge Uniformity

Computes the edge uniformity layout quality metric from the given graph having `x` and `y` positions attached to its nodes. Edge uniformity is the normalized standard deviation of edge length of the graph. Lower values should be synonym of better layout according to this particular metric.

Runs in `O(E)`.

```js
import edgeUniformity from 'graphology-metrics/layout-quality/edge-uniformity';

edgeUniformity(graph);
>>> ~1.132
```

### Neighborhood preservation

Computes the "neighborhood preservation" layout quality metric from the given graph having `x` and `y` positions attached to its nodes. Neighborhood preservation is the average proportion of node neighborhood being the same both in the graph's topology and its 2d layout space. The metric is therefore comprised between `0` and `1`, `1` being the best, meaning that every node keeps its neighborhood perfectly intact within the layout space.

Runs in approximately `O(N * log(N))`.

```js
import neighborhoodPreservation from 'graphology-metrics/layout-quality/neighborhood-preservation';

neighborhoodPreservation(graph);
// >>> 0.456
```

### Stress

Computes the "stress" layout quality metric from the given graph having `x` and `y` positions attached to its nodes. Stress is the sum of normalized delta between node topology distances and their layout space distances. Lower values should be synonym of better layout according to this particular metric.

Note that this metric does not work very well when the graph has multiple connected components.

Note also that this metric traverses any given graph as an undirected one.

Runs in `O(N^2)`.

```js
import stress from 'graphology-metrics/layout-quality/stress';

stress(graph);
// >>> ~24510.2914
```
